NewGrappleHook
==============

Code for the improved grapple hook weapon, both SP and MP code, with all the needed assets (including test map and fgd!). Original credits goes to the Obsidian Conflict Team for being the original creators of the weapon. Give to me (Maestro FÃ©nix) credits too if you are going to use this version. 

The list of improvements are the following:

-Replaced the spring method for vectors. It gives higher control to the player instead of just flying on all the directions.

-Added a rappel mode, so now players can descend/brake their falling speed safely.

-The grapple hook can fire now the "hook" faster (this could be done just with a viewmodel that has a fast reload, but it has been fixed at the code).

-Replaced the bolt and rope for a beam, to make it more pretty.

-The "hook" now can be seen right both in first and thirdperson. Before, due the way it was made, it looked fine at thirdperson, but it was moved at the viewmodel.

-Uses now the Gravity Gun model.
